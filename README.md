# login-usercrud
A login system with sessionfilter and user/phone crud, created with Maven, JSF, JPA and Hibernate.

The live app is on heroku at https://calm-basin-45764.herokuapp.com/login.xhtml (trying to solve a bug with heroku postgresql addon)

To make it run locally you need to configure persistance.xml to your database credentials.
After that, you can use Tomcat v8.5 to make it run on http://localhost:8080/br.com.pitang/login.xhtml
